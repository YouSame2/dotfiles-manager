# Prerequisites:

- dotbot
- yq

# Windows:

so far this is what ive done to get this to work on windows. Im still in the process making it.

In evalated PS:

## 1. Clone Dotfiles Repo

## 2. CHOCOLATEY
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```

## 3. Install DotBot

   ```pip install dotbot```

## 4. Update Submodule

   ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

## 5. Run Dotbot

   ```dotbot -c install.conf.yaml```

## 6. Install Nerd Fonts

## 7. Explainations

   - Shells & Aliases
   
     setting aliases across mac and windows is a bit scuffed so in the end i settled on this:

     windows i use git bash as my shell (currently, unless i find something better without WSL) and mac i use default zsh. doing this means both shells are fairly similar so i dont have to remember "oh, what was ls in windows again?"

     for aliases since windows uses bash and mac uses zsh just put os specific aliases in there corresponding dotfile. for universal aliases (that work on both platforms) put it into .config/aliases/.universal_aliases. this file is then sourced in both .zshrc and .bashrc ðŸ¤¯

# TODO:

still a lot to do as im learning bash and terminal.

- [x] consolodate dotfiles-add and dotfiles-sync into the same script taking args. So instead you use it like a normal cli: i.e. dotfiles add -m file1.lua
- [x] change format of yaml yq command so you can choose to specify if a committed dotfile should be MAC/WINDOWS/BOTH (-m -w) specific
- [x] change dotfiles-sync name (maybe link?)
- [x] change dotfiles-link function in script and aliases
- [x] fix git functionality and test it
- [x] add if statements for os specific symlinks
- [ ] when adding file/folder with no OS_FLAG (i.e. 'dotfiles add .config') in 'install.conf.yaml', if that file/folder already had an if statement the if statement wont get removed. this can lead so some unexpected behavior in rare situations. Im probably not going to deal with it since its niche, but feel free for a simple contribution if u want.
